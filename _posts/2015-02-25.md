What is a class?
What is a model?
What is a method?
What is a variable?
What is a request?
What is a route?
In the context of a web application, what is a "response"?

A class is an object type with specified behaviors (methods) and attributes.

A model is a class that directly relates/interacts with a table in the project's database.

A method is a block of code (usually within a class or module) that can be called by name.  It is used to avoid repeating yourself and to split up duties between classes/methods.

A variable is a modifiable symbol (not :symbol, I just mean that it stands in for the actual value).  It can be reassigned, and contain virtually any value.

A request is sent from a client (browser) to the server asking for a specific response/action.  A request usually contains some kind of parameters.

A route is the code that the web app runs when it recieves a specific response.  (get "/homepage" do)

A response is the view that is sent back to the client by the server, usually containing an html template and variable information that is defined in the route.
