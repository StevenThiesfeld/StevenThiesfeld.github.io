The difference between an API key and a gem, as I understand it is a gem is basically a small ruby program that you install on your computer.  An API on the other hand is a database you pull informantion from over the internet using an API key.  You can be denied access to an API if you traffic it too much, while I don't know of any such restrictions on gems.
