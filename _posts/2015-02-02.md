Working remotely was an interesting experience.  On one hand it was nice to be able to work while lounging around in pajamas, but on the other hand I feel like I was less efficient than I would have been working face to face with people.  In the future I would be okay with working remotely a 1 or 2 days a week, with the rest being face to face, but I don't think I would enjoy working 100% remotely.

.......And yes, I missed interacting with the instructors and the other students.
