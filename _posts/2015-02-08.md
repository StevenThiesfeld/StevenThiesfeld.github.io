Working in pairs for this project was... different.  I would have to say that it
slowed down the pace of development a bit, the biggest reason being having to 
coordinate with my partner over the weekend.  The problem wouldn't have been so
bad if there was more time in class to work in the meatspace on one computer, 
but syncing our code between two computers without the full power of github behind us was a drag.

  Despite the problems, I believe it was a valuable learning experience that will help prepare us for the real world.
