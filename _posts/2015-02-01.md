1: I feel like I understand the concepts of objects and classes well enough that I can explain a good amount of that subject to someone inexperienced.

2: Where I feel weakest is probably SSR and DRY.  I have a tendancy to throw too many things into single methods.  My lack of following DRY may be acceptable depending on varying personal preferences regarding the subject.

3: My non-coding highlight of the week is definitely the board game nights that have started popping up.  It's a good way to get to know the other class mates, and helps take your mind off coding for an hour or 2.
