There was alot of stuff to take in today, and to top it off we had to take it in remotely.  That being said, I think I have a somewhat solid grasp on databases.  I've already reverse engineered my dinner club program to accept databases.  As for how I'm improving in core concepts compared to how my interactions with arrays went in the prep work I'd say I'm improving significantly.
